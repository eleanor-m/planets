Cold and dry on Mars, but everything is my favourite colour.
The two moons may be a problem for Wolfman.

A bit more air pressure would be nice - let's try Venus.
Venus was toasty and I didn't like sweating all the time. Maybe we'll try Jupiter.

We might try to land near InSight and make Curiosity our pet!
